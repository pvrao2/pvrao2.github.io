<h2> Isomap and t-SNE </h2>
  
Some <strong><a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece598pv/fa2017/Lecture04_IsomapSNEtSNE_BryanClifford_PranavRao.pdf">notes</a></strong> I (and a peer) wrote on the dimensional reduction strategies isomap and t-SNE. These notes were featured on the course website for a "Representation Learning" course at Illinois.
