      I'm a doctoral candidate in Physics at the University of Illinois, and live in Champaign. 
    </p>
    <p>
       My work is focused on non-dissipative transport in topological materials and some exotic classical systems. Recently, I've been preparing to transition into the field of quantum computing, where I'm excited 
      (among other things) about applying quantum algorithms to aid in the understanding of physical systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time, I roast (pretty decent) coffee, make pizza, and quick-pickle things.
